# 🧠 CertNode v3.3: Logic Needs a Ledger

What if every nonfiction article, AI output, and academic paper came with a receipt?

Not just a timestamp or a source — but a **logic-certified audit**, signed by a vault, tiered by rigor, and validated by AI that understands structure.

Welcome to **CertNode v3.3** — the world’s first runtime engine for certifying the **logical integrity of text**, with:

✅ Vault-signed audit logs  
✅ Stripe-powered usage billing  
✅ Claude + Manus ingestion-ready capsules  
✅ API-first slope-tier evaluation (T0–T16)

## 🧠 Why Logic Needs a Ledger

The internet was built for speed — not structure. In a world flooded by hallucinations, rhetorical manipulation, and biased framing, **we need a neutral system to validate nonfiction**.

CertNode doesn’t "fact-check". It measures:

- Logical slope and structural depth  
- Clause interlock and recursion  
- Valence manipulation and tier volatility

And it does so **at scale**, for humans *and* AI.
