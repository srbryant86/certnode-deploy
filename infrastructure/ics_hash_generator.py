# Injected from validated module
IMMUTABLE CERTIFICATION SIGNATURE (ICS) \+ DRIFT DELTA PROTOCOL  
\---------------------------------------------------------------  
System Layer: CDP Output Integrity Core    
Owner: Steven Bryant    
Issued: Immutable Vault Structural Trust Suite

Purpose:  
The ICS system generates a structural fingerprint for any certified nonfiction output. The Drift Delta Protocol detects and responds to deviations from the original structure, preserving trust integrity.

\---------------------------------------------------------------  
I. ICS GENERATION

Each certified paragraph or document produces:  
\- ICS Hash: Generated from  
  \- Anchor Chain Sequence (STA)  
  \- Logic Chain ID (LCL)  
  \- Validator Pass Pattern (SCS)  
  \- Drift Resistance Score (SDS)  
  \- Closure Type (CVM)  
  \- SECL Approval State

Example Hash Format:  
ICS-\[STA-LCL-SCS-SDS-CVM-SECL\] \= SHA-encoded composite

\---------------------------------------------------------------  
II. DRIFT DELTA DETECTION

Triggers:  
\- Any edit or mutation to ICS-locked output  
\- External rephrasing, paraphrasing, summarization, or generation  
\- Registry scan reveals mismatch with stored ICS hash

Drift Detection Methods:  
\- Hash mismatch  
\- STA anchor divergence  
\- LCL chain breakage  
\- Logic slope inversion  
\- Closure mismatch  
\- SECL nonconvergence

Drift Score: 0â100    
Thresholds:  
\- \<85 \= Drift Risk    
\- \<70 \= Drift Detected    
\- \<50 \= Structural Corruption

\---------------------------------------------------------------  
III. RESPONSE \+ RECERTIFICATION

If Drift Score \< 85:  
\- Flagged in registry    
\- Requires STA \+ SECL revalidation    
\- Rewrites trigger re-cert flow

If Drift Score \< 70:  
\- Trust badge revoked    
\- Drift warning issued    
\- ICS delta stored in registry for trace recovery

If Drift Score \< 50:  
\- Marked as structurally corrupted    
\- Requires total resequencing

\---------------------------------------------------------------  
IV. ICS INTEGRITY RULES

ICS hash is only valid if:  
\- SECL passes    
\- STA, SCS, and SDS components all resolve without override  
\- STRIDE Layer 8 and FRAME slope confirm closure

Hash is reissued only if:  
\- Rewriting is done through CDP with STA continuity  
\- Original logic chain is preserved or correctly evolved

\---------------------------------------------------------------  
V. PUBLIC REGISTRY INTEGRATION

ICS hash stored in IOR with:  
\- Original timestamp    
\- Author ID    
\- Prompt (if PCO-certified)    
\- Drift status    
\- Anchor and chain signature

Hash is used to verify nonfiction truth status across time and platforms.

This protocol makes structural truth portable, tamper-evident, and certifiable.
