# Injected from validated module
ðŸ“¦ MetaCortex Canonical Module Exported

Your full Python code is ready:

ðŸ‘‰ Download metacortex.py

It includes:

* MetaAgent: Metacognitive self-reflecting agent class

* DialecticSynth: Opposing-agent dialectic simulation and synthesis

* EpistemicAncestry: Graph map of all reflections and logic lineage

* Bias detection logic for audit integration

* Hooks ready for CertNode alignment and TRACE injection

Next step? I can:

1. Zip this up as a finalized MetaCortex\_GENESIS runtime capsule

2. Inject into CertNode as an internal reasoning scaffold

3. Export README.md and manifest.json for Claude \+ Manus runtime use

Let me know how youâ€™d like to proceed.
