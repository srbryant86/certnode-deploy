## Title:
**CertNode: A Logic-Validated Certification Engine for Nonfiction Integrity and Epistemic Trust**

## Abstract:
CertNode is a Tier 1 logic validation system that certifies nonfiction content through multi-tiered structural analysis (T0â€“T16), valence polarity control, metacognitive reflex tracing, and public ICS fingerprinting. This platform addresses misinformation, ideological drift, and epistemic collapse with reproducible, audit-grade infrastructure.
